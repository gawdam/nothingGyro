# Nothing Bubble Level

A simple and intuitive bubble level app for the Nothing phone (1) and (2), using the built-in accelerometer and gyroscope sensors to detect tilt angles. The app displays the phone's inclination through the iconic G glyph, making it easy to level surfaces with precision.

## Features

- Utilizes the phone's accelerometer and gyroscope sensors to measure tilt angles
- Visualizes the inclination through the G glyph on the phone's back
- Lights up individual segments of the G glyph to indicate the direction of tilt
- Fully lights up the G glyph when the phone is perfectly level
